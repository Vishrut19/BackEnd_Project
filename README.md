# PearTree_BackEnd_Task
I tried to host it on Vercel and Netlify but both are not happening for me. But, I have followed all the guidelines mentioned in the Email containing the test details as well as **Guidelines** and I tried to complete **Bonus Challenge** as well.

# Steps to Run the Project :

1. Clone the Repo using :
